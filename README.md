# Stock Trading Smart Contract  

This project is a simple stock trading system built on Ethereum using Solidity.  
It allows users to buy and sell stocks by interacting directly with the smart contract.  
Each stock has a name, price, and available quantity, and user balances are tracked securely.  

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how decentralized trading can be modeled on-chain.  
It includes basic functions for adding stocks, purchasing, and selling them with Ether.  

You can explore and test the contract live in Remix IDE:
